					<h2>Collaborative Discussion 1 Summary</h2>
					<p>&emsp;The case study involving Q Industries highlights the ethical dilemmas faced in the development of automated active response weaponry for government contractors. It critically examines Q Industries' adherence to the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018) and the BCS Code of Conduct (British Computer Society, 2022), revealing multiple ethical violations. These include justifying harm, neglecting human rights, and the potential for autonomous weaponry to ignore the privacy of innocent bystanders.</p>
	<p>&emsp;Furthermore, Q's technology raises concerns over discrimination and noncompliance with legislation, pointing to a disregard for public interests, health, and privacy threats.
The engineers' decision to resign and speak out against these practices while risking a lawsuit is positioned as a complex ethical choice. This action, though potentially in violation of certain principles related to the duty to relevant authority by publicizing sensitive information, is argued to demonstrate professional integrity and compliance with ethical codes. It underscores the demanding ethical landscape professionals navigate when their moral convictions clash with their organizational obligations.</p>
	<p>&emsp;The discussion suggests that while the engineers' actions might breach some privacy principles, their efforts to raise public awareness about the risks of uncontrolled technology development align with broader ethical considerations. This scenario illuminates the nuanced ethical challenges faced by professionals in the technology sector, advocating for a balanced approach that prioritizes ethical standards and the public interest in the face of complex technological innovations.</p>
	<p>&emsp;For me, such a deep ethical application into complex processes is a new and exciting area. The post-soviet environment of my development and Eastern European culture often neglect ethical validation in the process of decision-making. I see significant challenges and potential obstacles which may slow down reforms that are expected to be made in the near future here in Ukraine. However, I see how ethics may improve processes in our developing environment, provoking further improvements in people's lives.</p>
