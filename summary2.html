					<h2>Collaborative Discussion 2 Summary</h2>
					<p>&emsp;Abi, a researcher and statistical programmer, is facing a tough decision about how to report his findings on a new cereal named Whizzz. He has found that the cereal might not be as nutritious as claimed and could even be harmful. He's considering showing the data in a way that could make the cereal look better, but he's unsure if this is right.</p>
					<p>&emsp;Ethically, changing data or how it's shown to make something seem better than it is is wrong. The Universal Ethical Code for Scientists says scientists must be honest and avoid doing anything that could mislead others (GOV.UK, 2007). So, if Abi only shows the cereal in a positive light, he's not being honest and violates The Universal Ethical Code for Scientists. Abi should share both the good and the bad findings about the cereal. This is part of being responsible in how he communicates his work. Not sharing the full picture can damage people's trust in science.</p>
					<p>&emsp;Q: Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study, he would be acting unethically. But is it any more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions?</p>
					<p>&emsp;I think it's the wrong question. Food quality and questions of the harm or benefits they may pose are complex problems that may have no solid answers. For example, the history of sugar research shows that, in the beginning, companies often interpreted research results to advertise the benefits of sugar products to increase sales. Then came the era of sugar shame, with many researchers stating its harm to health, and only at the beginning of the 21st century did researchers agree that sugar consumption cannot be evaluated on its own without measuring dosage and other parameters (Khan & Sievenpiper, 2016). In the case of Abi, the analysis should be carefully done according to standards provided by local agencies, for example, by the Food Standards Agency in the UK. Abi also has to think about how the cereal company might use his findings. Even if he can't control what the company does, he should make sure his report is clear and fair. </p>
					<p>&emsp;Q: Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?</p>
					<p>&emsp;Abi is obligated to present all the findings rather than focusing on negative or positive analyses. The same finding in different contexts may be interpreted both as positive or negative. The researcher's task is to represent and analyse the result according to actual guidelines and present scientific knowledge about the subject.</p>
						  <p>&emsp;Q: Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results?</p>
					<p>&emsp;If the analysis has been done correctly, according to actual guidelines and scientific discoveries, which were referenced in the research, he is not responsible if the company misinterprets his analysis. Moreover, charlatans and fake experts whose incorrect interpretations of good research are a widespread phenomenon today pose significant risks to civil health (Lindem, 2014).</p>
						  
						  <p>&emsp;If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that they will publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he?</p>
					<p>&emsp;If Abi worries that the company will only share some parts of his report, he should talk to them about the importance of being honest. Legally, he needs to make sure his work follows food safety laws, like those from the Food Standards Agency in the UK, which say food information must be truthful (Food Standards Agency, 2024).</p>
					
					<p>&emsp;Abi's decision has significant implications. If he does not report his findings honestly, it could harm the public's trust in scientific research and food safety. Professionally, it could hurt his reputation and career.</p>
					<p>&emsp;In short, Abi must report his findings on Whizzz honestly, showing both positives and negatives. </p>
