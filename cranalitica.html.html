					<h2>Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>&emsp;The Cambridge Analytica scandal (Confessore, 2018) serves as an essential example of how surveys can be misused for alternative purposes, in this case, to obtain the data of millions of Facebook users without their explicit consent and use it for political manipulation. This incident appeared when Cambridge Analytica, a political data analytics firm, acquired a considerable amount of personal information through a survey app called "This Is Your Digital Life." Users who participated in the survey unknowingly granted access not only to their own Facebook data but also to the data of their friends, leading to a massive breach of private information.</p>
<p>&emsp;Big companies which process vast amounts of data may accidentally collect private information, which could also pose security risks. For example, Google admitted that its Street View cars, while photographing streets around the world, unwittingly collected data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks, including emails and passwords (Burdon & McKillop, 2014). While not through a survey, this incident highlights how data collection efforts can overreach and infringe on personal privacy. Regular corporate data breaches could also have a disruptive impact on privacy and lead to improper use of user data collected by tech giants, which raises ethical and legal concerns (Spinello, 2021).</p>

<p>&emsp;Ethical risks and impacts:</p>

<p>&emsp;1. Breaking Privacy Rules: The examples show how user privacy was broken, with people's trust betrayed and their data used wrongly beyond what they agreed to.</p>
<p>&emsp;2. Tricking for Consent: People were tricked into giving permission for their data to be used, without being told how it would really be used. This also includes ethical risks because it's not right to use someone's data without their clear agreement.</p>
<p>&emsp;Social effects:</p>
<p>&emsp;Losing Trust: These problems made people trust online companies and tech less, making them careful about using online services. Also, it poses trust issues toward academic surveys, which may result in the following a decrease in the obtained information quality. </p>
<p>&emsp;Legal consequences:</p>
<p>&emsp;Government Action: The Cambridge Analytica issue got a lot of attention from governments in the UK, the US, and other places, leading to demands for stricter laws to protect data. This helped bring about important rules like the GDPR in Europe.</p>
<p>&emsp;Legal Trouble for Companies: The companies involved got into legal trouble, had to pay fines, and had to change how they handle data.</p>
<p>&emsp;More obstacles for obtaining data: Companies and researches should spend more time on checking possibilities of legal issues, which may lead to prolonged procedures and slower progress.</p>
<p>&emsp;Professional outcomes:</p>
<p>&emsp;Changing Industry Rules: These issues made the tech industry think again about its standards, stressing the need to handle data ethically.</p>
<p>&emsp;Ethics in the Profession: They show that tech professionals need to follow ethical rules that protect people's privacy and be clear about how data is collected and used.</p>
<p>&emsp;In short, using surveys to collect data without clear permission shows big ethical, social, legal, and professional problems. These issues highlight the need for strong ethical rules, strict laws to protect data, and a promise to be clear and protect user privacy in the tech and academic worlds.</p>
