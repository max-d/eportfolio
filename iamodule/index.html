<h1 id="introduction-to-agent-based-computing">Introduction to
Agent-Based Computing</h1>
<p>During week one of the course, we were introduced to the concept of
agent-based computation. Prior to this, I had encountered the term
“agent” when observing Alpha Start AI playing StarCraft 2 against human
opponents. However, at that time, I did not delve into the reason behind
machines being referred to as “agents.” Wooldridge (2009) shed light on
this term, defining an agent as a computer system existing within an
environment, capable of perceiving it and autonomously taking actions.
Despite this seemingly straightforward explanation, the theory turned
out to be more complex and nuanced. It brought forth various questions,
with “autonomy” being the primary but not the sole concept. Unlike a
mere software program or daemon, which solely deals with inputs and
outputs, an agent operates in a dynamic and volatile environment.
Personally, this concept is new to me, yet it resonates well with my
previous experience working with intricate distributed software systems.
While my prior expertise was limited to traditional software approaches,
I was pleasantly surprised to discover the widespread use of agent-based
systems across multiple industries. Unfortunately, I was unable to
participate in the initial collaborative discussion. Nonetheless, upon
reviewing the posts later, I came across intriguing information about
how diverse sectors embrace agent-based systems. For instance, I was
fascinated to learn that researchers in biology employ “The Virtual
Cell” systems to test hypotheses (vcell.org, 2023). However, when
compared to conventional software solutions, agent-based systems are
still in the developmental phase, with numerous research outweighing
actual implemented solutions. The content covered in the first unit
sparked numerous ideas regarding the implementation of agent-based
solutions within the industry I currently work in.</p>
<h1 id="first-order-logic">First Order Logic</h1>
<p>During the second week of our studies, we looked into First Order
Logic (FOL), which serves as a means of knowledge representation. In the
context of computers, the structuring of knowledge becomes essential for
comprehension. My initial exposure to this concept occurred many years
ago during my graduation when I undertook a Prolog programming course.
Consequently, the concepts explained by Russell &amp; Norvig (2021) felt
quite familiar, harking back to my earlier learning experiences.
However, despite this familiarity, I had never actively applied this
knowledge, and initially, this unit appeared to be rather intricate.</p>
<p>The seminar conducted during the week significantly contributed to my
understanding of First Order Logic, clarifying its concepts and
principles. As a software engineer, much of my work revolves around
bridging human-understandable industry knowledge and processes with
machine-readable code. Consequently, grasping the fundamentals of First
Order Logic was relatively easy. Nonetheless, limited experience in
declarative programming could present hurdles to understanding FOL. Most
programming languages predominantly adopt an imperative approach to
organising program flow. Consequently, I encountered some difficulties
initially, but I soon realised that FOL can be pretty straightforward
and practical for complex systems.</p>
<h1 id="agent-architectures">Agent Architectures</h1>
<p>During the third week, we explored agent architectures. I must admit
that the reading list provided for this module wasn’t perfect. It needed
to have the structure of solid academic sources I met in previous
modules. Nonetheless, it did present several intriguing ideas, such as
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and behavioural models, which were
inspired by beards and other agent-related topics. Despite the
unstructured nature of the information, I still found many valuable
ideas that could be applied to my job. However, I noticed that the
knowledge presented leaned more towards the technical aspects rather
than theoretical insights. This may become a challenge for students who
need a technical background in interpreting the provided sources. To
improve the learning experience, inspecting the unit’s lecturecasts
before looking into the reading list would be beneficial. This way,
students can grasp the basic ideas that are later described in the
provided articles. Overall, this unit offered a wealth of interesting
information, which proved to be useful for our assignments. During
inspecting the literature, a particular image of agent architecture
appeared in our group discussion.</p>
<h1 id="hybrid-agent-architectures">Hybrid Agent Architectures</h1>
<p>During the fourth week, we delved into Hybrid agent architectures.
This particular architecture combines both proactive and reactive
approaches in the design of agents, making it potentially valuable for
tackling complex problems. Each approach, whether reactive or proactive,
has its own strengths and weaknesses, and its effectiveness depends on
the specific task at hand. However, the hybrid architecture offers a
more flexible and adaptable approach. I found Wooldridge’s (2009)
theoretical explanations and practical implementations, such as
“Stanley,” to be particularly insightful. The multi-layer approach, with
its various directions of interactions, initially puzzled me, but I
eventually grasped its significance. One aspect that still raises some
doubts for me is the practical implementation of these architectures.
Based on my commercial experience, I have come to believe that “good”
solutions tend to be the simplest ones, which can be developed and
maintained by less experienced developers, with a focus on resolving
straightforward problems. This approach has proven useful throughout my
decade of working with distributed systems, designing and managing them.
I don’t oppose sophisticated solutions that can efficiently solve
complex problems, especially in the realm of AI. However, in the modern
world, with its vast computational resources and cloud technologies,
there is a push towards designing solutions that are both simple,
possibly ineffective and resource-intensive. ChatGPT itself is an
example of such a resource-expensive solution. This could be an
interesting topic for further discussion and exploration.</p>
<h1 id="agent-communication">Agent Communication</h1>
<p>In the fifth unit, we delved into the fascinating topic of agent
communication and KQML. The lecturecast was easy to understand, but I
found the provided literature, especially “Speech Acts: An Essay in the
Philosophy of Language,” to be rather complex. It took me some time to
get the basic ideas presented in it. However, the paper by Payne &amp;
Tamma (2014) was easier to understand, likely due to its more practical
approach.</p>
<p>Throughout the unit, several interesting questions were raised. I was
particularly captivated by the concept of ontology and knowledge-related
exchange. In software development, we often use context containers to
exchange knowledge about the environment, but they tend to offer limited
information specific to the software’s working environment. I imagine
ontology as a context based on knowledge, providing a more profound and
knowledge-driven approach to communication. This could potentially
enhance the flexibility of agent communication but at the cost of
greater efforts required to describe and represent ontologies.</p>
<p>Overall, this unit proved to be quite interesting yet complex,
leaving me with more questions than answers. I found the exploration of
agent communication and ontologies exciting, which I plan to learn more
about.</p>
<h1 id="working-together">Working Together</h1>
<p>In week six, we focused on the practical aspect of KQML.
Unsurprisingly, it appeared to have a declarative LISP style, providing
solid opportunities to structure messages. However, I have found it too
high level, without practical meaning to what we call modern systems.
KQML provides a simple model for understanding agent communication, but
I can’t imagine actual distributed systems which will gain some
advantages from implementing ACL as a high-level protocol description.
It rather fits classic multi-agent systems, which are built around
meaningful knowledge exchange.</p>
<p>During another part of the week, we spent our time completing our
assignment. Early on, we faced the challenge of dealing with different
time zones among group members. However, despite the initial struggles,
we managed to find a way to achieve at least one hour of daily group
communication later on.</p>
<p>Instead of adopting a sophisticated Software Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) with its potential overheads, we opted for a straightforward and
simple workflow. Each team member focused on their respective strengths,
allowing us to leverage everyone’s expertise effectively. Additionally,
every participant was encouraged to share their ideas regarding the
multi-agent system architecture based on their understanding of the
subject.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we collectively decided to concentrate on a single-agent
architecture, which could serve as a foundation for building a
multi-agent system in the future. Working together as a team has been a
rewarding experience, and we are looking forward to exploring the
possibilities further.</p>
<p>We decided to use a simple Agent design consisting of 3 parts:
sensors, an analysis module, actuator. All agents should have the same
basic class, which implements abstract interaction between these three
modules. Particular agent realisation should have a basic agent class
and custom implementation for each module. This later could be used to
implement a dependency injection pattern, which allows flexible
implementation of the system, when different specialists could focus on
developing functionality, they are experienced at. I see this approach
as a good choice for systems which demand effective collaboration of AI
specialists and experienced software engineers.</p>
<p>For our first version, we created a simple playground which consisted
of one Agent whose responsibility was to read the environment, get DNA
sample requests, match them to the database and create a notification if
the sample was found. Nevertheless, the design was simple, and we spent
some time to make it work properly. A test playground was created to
demonstrate that our model worked properly.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoyed this assignment because it is what I like about
software engineering: designing and building PoCs. My teammates were
also excited we got such good results. Nevertheless, I had some
unfavourable circumstances and was stressed by situations not related to
my studies and lost time to make practical tasks for the e-portfolio,
the group was so supportive and nice, I managed to focus on my part of
the job and hit the deadlines. It was another reminder that supportive
teams perform much better under any circumstances, sometimes showing the
result that beats expectations. I was glad to have such nice students in
my group.</p>
<h1 id="natural-language-processing-nlp">Natural Language Processing
(NLP)</h1>
<p>Unit 7 brought another exciting theme. It is nearly impossible to
imagine a modern world without language translators, voice recognition,
and now without ChatGPT. Both the lecturecast and reading list provided
sufficient detail to understand the basics. However, before the course,
I thought NLP was a less complex subject. The literature revealed how
wide and universal this area. However, it also revealed many complex
ethical and philosophical problems, which are somehow inevitable when we
work with phrases, meanings and interpretations. I enjoyed to deep down
into the technical aspects of NLP but was puzzled by some state of
frustration when it came to deeper analysis of language structure.</p>
<p>Also, this week we finished our collaborative discussions regarding
agents’ communication in multi-agent systems.</p>
<p>Multi-agent systems have become increasingly prevalent in various
domains, ranging from robotics and automation to social networks and
smart cities. As the complexity of these systems grows, the need for
effective communication and coordination among agents becomes crucial.
Agent Communication Language (ACL) is a powerful tool that facilitates
interaction and collaboration among agents, enabling them to work
together towards a common goal. ACL could be considered a high-level
language which provides suitable tools for transferring knowledge in
multi-agent systems (Finin et al. 1993). All advantages and
disadvantages of ACLs are mainly related to the application area and
system size. For small multi-agent systems, ACLs may be more profitable.
Complex multi-agent systems could have a massive array of data with
complicated structures and agents which works with different ontologies.
The wider the distribution of the multi-agent system, the more
complicated messaging among agents could become. The difference in
knowledge that agents operate may require significant efforts to align
ontologies, which may cause further complexity raise. Large systems
could potentially have the same problems that any extensive distribution
system has, such as connection problems, queue management complexity,
data fragmentation and accessibility (Twardowski et al., 2014).</p>
<p>However, researchers already provide experimental frameworks which
allow the implementation of ACLs solution atop of systems, which resolve
mentioned problems. For example, Multi-Agent Framework (Kawamura et
al. 2005) allows implementing agents’ communication in multi-agent
systems using XML-RPC for messaging. Furthermore, the Domain-Driven
Design approach may help with dividing such systems into layers, where
each layer represents a realisation of different elements (Steinegger,
2017). For example, ACL may be isolated on the top domain level, while
protocol communication, data representation, and parallel computations
could be done by low-level code. Such an approach could decrease the
potential complexity of the Agent’s implementation for knowledge domain
specialists while providing flexibility and performance for agent
communication.</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed the discussions and was impressed by how modern
technologies empower agent-based systems.</p>
<h1 id="understanding-natural-language-processing-nlp">Understanding
Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h1>
<p>In unit 8, we deepened down into NLP and learned about Word2Vec. I
believe this unit has changed my sceptical attitude towards NLP theory
because of a more practical approach which links the theory to
particular structures and ideas.</p>
<p>Parse trees task link</p>
<h1 id="introduction-to-adaptive-algorithms">Introduction to Adaptive
Algorithms</h1>
<p>In unit 9, we looked into adaptive algorithms and ANNs particularly.
Lecturecast and literature provided plenty of interesting information.
In addition to the knowledge gained during the “Machine Learning”
module, I believe in getting a deep enough understanding of the basic
concepts and problems of ANNs. Unfortunately, the time of
superintelligence didn’t come yet, and will not come for future decades.
Today’s marketing wars in an attempt to bring investments push society’s
opinion towards the illusion that AI is close to surpassing human
limits, providing more discussions on ethics and containment of AI,
while the industry can’t even create cheap and precise solutions for
image object recognition. While doing an assignment for another module,
I was surprised by the amount of preparation, EDA, and applying image
preprocessing filters to just recognise pictures with a precision close
to 0.7. This unit definitely added some frustration, not about materials
quality, but about the state of the industry at all. It’s still far from
achieving significant results in competing with humans.</p>
<h1 id="deep-learning-in-action">Deep Learning in Action</h1>
<p>During week 10, our focus shifted to the practical aspects of deep
learning applications. While AI still can’t fully compete with humans in
certain domains, machine learning algorithms have the potential to
surpass human limitations in specific tasks. For instance, though ML
models may not yet achieve the same precision as humans in object
recognition, they excel in recognising objects faster and over extended
periods with less effort. Industries that don’t necessarily require
absolute precision can benefit from using deep learning models, as they
offer profitable solutions. It’s important to note that AI is not meant
to replace humans but rather to empower them. By taking on tasks that
demand rapid context changes, making multiple choices, or handling
repetitive actions, AI can complement human abilities. For example,
projects like Gitlab Copilot cannot replace software engineers, but they
can certainly enhance a developer’s performance by providing useful
assistance. Similarly, while ChatGPT may not solve complex problems
outright for students, it offers structured information that can
expedite the process of developing comprehensive solutions. In my
opinion, supporting deep learning research and solutions is a positive
step forward, as it equips us better to tackle future challenges.
Embracing AI technology wisely can lead to a more efficient and
productive world where humanity will be prepared for future challenges
much better.</p>
<h1 id="intelligent-agents-in-action">Intelligent Agents in Action</h1>
<p>During week 11, we explored Industry 4.0 and other applications of
Agent-based technologies and deep learning. AI technologies may
significantly improve manufacturing and, I believe, should replace
convenient old lines. Automatisation isn’t going to decrease workplaces,
and rather, it will improve manufacturing, making it more effective and
safe, decreasing pricing, and providing decent quality. People may focus
more on sophisticated jobs, spending more time resolving interesting
problems. In my opinion, Industry 4.0 is a step toward fully automated
manufacturing, which could be moved to space, allowing people to explore
planets of the Solar system and moving potentially dangerous
technologies out of Earth. I am really exited about Industry 4.0 concept
and its challenges. This is a possible area I want to work in. I
absolutely support using of AI also in the financial area, which is my
native industry I spent so much time in. This area is overly regulated
by policies, and any financial operation could be delayed for weeks for
a simple AML check, which could be done by the Agent-based system in
seconds.</p>
<p>Also, we spent this week finishing our second assignment. This time
our team showed even better performance. We used the same workflow,
where everyone, who had time, took a part in the planned work regarding
their experience. However, this time, we focused more on all aspects of
the assignment. Everyone participated in creating the programme design
and selecting patterns. Also, all team members participated in the
presentation recording. We used the same universal agent design but
added more agents and developed communication-based on custom format ACL
messages. Also, new structure were provided, where all entities were
separated into different libraries. For testing, we decided to avoid
network communication because it could potentially add complexity to
realisation yet barely represent ideas we designed to implement. So, a
single script where all agents and environments are being initialised
was proposed. We decided to make communication through the custom queue
manager, which was represented by the Singleton pattern. It allowed
creating of designs close to real commercial systems, where all services
communicate through the queues, supported by industry-grade programs
like RabbitMQ. Also, shared contained can be easily updated to simulate
network behaviour like delays, disconnects, etc., so the system may be
further improved to meet requirements for distributed multi-agent
architecture.</p>
<p>I admire our group because everyone did their best to have a great
result. We have managed to improve our solution in regards to the good
feedback provided to the first assignment. The only thing, which was my
responsibility, had flaws. However, other aspects of the project were
improved. I was glad to participate in this simple but interesting
project.</p>
<h1 id="the-future-of-intelligent-agents">The Future of Intelligent
Agents</h1>
<p>In Unit 12, we explored the future of agent-based deep learning
technologies. I’m hopeful that this field will progress at an
accelerated pace. Present-day solutions have achieved remarkable
effectivity through the combination of well-known but relatively old
algorithms like ANNs, alongside the utilisation of vast computational
resources from Big Data and Cloud technologies. While this has yielded
significant advancements, the future expects us to focus on
energy-efficient and eco-friendly technologies.</p>
<p>As researchers, our attention should be directed towards exploring
novel approaches and modifying existing ones. The goal is to make AI
solutions more accessible and applicable in all aspects of our daily
lives. This requires a concerted effort to achieve a balance between
performance and effectiveness.</p>
